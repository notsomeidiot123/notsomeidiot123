### Pronouns: she/her

I am a college student and hobbyist, and I love low-level, close-to-hardware programming!

Im currently working on Kimi's OS, an x86 modular operating system, found (here)[https://github.com/notsomeidiot123/kimisos]

If you have any issues with any of my software (idk why you're using it, but thank you :heart:!) email me @ kiminosei321@gmail.com! I'll gladly try to fix any bugs that are reported there. 

I'm also really bored like 90% of the time, so if you need any help with any project, just email me, and i'll try my best to help!
